#Slick Brownbag

Split into three branches:
* `Master` showing how to set up a database connection and demonstrating the syntax of Slick.
* `Evolutions` showing how to get Evolutions working.
* `EmbeddedDB` showing how to set up a H2 embedded database.

The notes are intended as a reminder of the brownbag rather than an alternative to it. The notes aren't labeled in any order so it might be a little confusing following through without having got the idea through the brownbag.
